# The Inject Method

This is a simple repository in order to understand the powerful inject method which should become an integral part of anyone's Ruby arsenal.

##### The challenge
- Reopen the array class/subclass it.
- Assume a block is always given.
- Rewrite the inject method with tests showing success.
- Give the method a different name due to RSpec's internal DSL.

##### Technologies used
- Ruby 2.1.2
- Rspec 3.1.7
